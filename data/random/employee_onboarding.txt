Employee onboarding is handled through the HRMS system.

The process involves:
- Document submission (Aadhar, PAN, Bank details)
- IT asset allocation
- Email ID and system access provisioning

Every new employee is assigned an onboarding coordinator who ensures all steps are completed in 7 working days. The onboarding status can be tracked from the HRMS dashboard.
