The loan application process in our organization follows a strict three-tier approval system:

1. Maker: Responsible for entering all loan data into the system.
2. Checker: Reviews the data entered by the Maker and verifies for accuracy.
3. Approver: Gives final approval based on eligibility and available budget.

A loan cannot move to the next stage until the current stage is successfully completed. Each role has their own dashboard to track and manage loan entries.
